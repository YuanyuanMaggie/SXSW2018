## What I learned from this conference 

- `"After attending many conferences, I’ve realized: I don’t attend to learn. I attend to learn what I need to learn."`  — Cory House. So here is my new learning lists: graphQl, vuejs, PWA/AMP, Aria/A11y and VR/AR.
- It's not hard to make a conference talk, if you want to attract more people, have a fancy name. For example, `Learn XXX under 1 hour`, `Intro to XXX and more`, etc. And then, fill the XXX with something popular. For example, `blockchain`, `machine learning`, or `artificial intelligent`.
- Humor is the key point for keynote speakers
- Fun Videos, images, jokes and Q&As with audiences are all good openings 
- Notes for becoming a good speaker:
    - Fun stories
    - Passion about speech
    - Raise hand interactions
    - Change speed (sometime slow down and make it powerful)
