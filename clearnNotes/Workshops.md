# Intro to GraphQL: The Future Language of the Web*

## Intro
Software is eating the world. At the forefront of the software revolution is the explosion of internet services that continue to redefine how we work, play and interact with one another. For almost 20 years, the web as we know it has been built on REST interfaces that allow developers to query and manipulate data across the internet. In 2015, Facebook inspired the world to think about what the next 20 years of the web would look like when they introduced GraphQL - a new common query language for the modern web.
