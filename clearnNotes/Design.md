# 1. Choice Architects (Design for Humanity's Best Self)

## 1.1. Intro
Today’s digital landscape feeds our lizard brains and reduces complex moral dilemmas to the swipe of a thumb. As product creators, we have a responsibility to present people with a set of choices to enable them to be the best version of themselves. This panel will discuss examples of dark user interface patterns wreaking havoc on our lives. We will empower you to positively impact humanity through products designed for a world that doesn't suck.

# 4. Changing Minds: Behavioral Science for Designers

## 4.1. Intro
When building technologies, we often have specific behavioral goals in mind: things we want users to think, feel, and do. Before, our research & design processes rarely included behavior change science. That's no longer true. Join a Chief Behavioral Officer, a Researcher, and a UX Designer for debate about psychology-based methods for product and service design. They’ll share experiences about working to translate the science into actionable practice.

## 4.2. Notes

- What cause Behavior change?
  - Motivation
  - B=mat
  - simplicity change people mindset/behavior
- design for human connection
- It took nearly 50 years for people to accept the automated lift
- How do you design for TRUST?

# 5. Animation in UX: Subconscious Influence of Motion
Katie Swindler
## 5.1. Intro
If you’re not leveraging interface animations to influence your users, you are missing a critical component of UX design. Like body language, motion design supplies a rich, often-subconscious layer of meaning & personality to every micro-interaction. Digital products can leverage the same techniques used by cartoon animators, actors & dancers to convey personality, improve comprehension & influence behavior through movement. Learn the right animation styles for your brand, users & product.
