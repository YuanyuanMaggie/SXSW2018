# 1. What Is Blockchain? How Will It Change The World?
## 1.1. Intro
Blockchain technology is often compared with the Internet and the impact of it is expected to be even greater. We are already witnessing how it is radically transforming the world and have realised that it is not just a toy for geeks, but an efficient tool which can be deployed by financial institutions, businesses, governments and individuals. But how does it actually work? Dr. Julian Hosp, one of the worldâ€™s top blockchain experts, will explain the basics of blockchain, why it's the beginning of a new era and what profound possibilities it can bring to society and economy. It is his mission to help people all around the world to become #cryptofit for the new decentralized world. Are you ready to join the revolution?
