# 4+ Billion AMP Pages: The Future of the Mobile Web *

The Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) Project enables websites to provide fast, engaging user experiences. Now AMP has expanded beyond publishing to areas such as e-commerce, advertising, and powering entire websites - adding richer interactivity and support for Progressive Web Apps (PWAs). AMP delivers content at lightning speed with a reliably great user experience â€“ whether for news, e-commerce, or the entirety of a website. Join Chen for the latest on the AMP Project and the ecosystem.

# Building Mobile SDK's for the Real World

1. Simplify your code
- Limit points of failure
    - Limit use of internal state variables
    - Minimize code paths
    - Don't rely on startup routine
    (dont use the variable before verify it)
- Choose dependencies Carefully
    - Normally Great - Problematic in SDK's
- Logging Tells Your Story

2. Run trasparently - SDK's Sean not Heard
- Be vigilant in threading
- Perform regardless of granted permissions
    - Graceful degradation
- Error handling
    - Suppress dialogs, handle as much as you can

3. Release Seriously
- Versioniing is critical for debugging
- Build a release checklist for `everything` - and/or automate
- Sample Code / Sameple Implementation
    - Have a "simple" version to increase adoption
    - Advanced version shows all options
