Fun to know:
- We touch our phones an average of 2,617 times a day

### Dark Patterns
Interfaces that have been crafted to trick users into unintentionally doing things

- short term thinking vs long term thinking
[exmaple of hair]

- Bad Product matrix. For example, Time spend on site => bad UX (confusing navigation)

### Cognitive Bias

The tendency of people to erroneously perceive information and make irrational decisions based on their own experiences and preferences

`We are so obsessed with our phones, we touch them 2617 times a day`

`Our biggest competitor is sleep... and we're winning.`
- Netfix CEO 

Designers will have responsibility to step in and manage the KPI and the humanity

### Choice Architecture

The way chocies are presented to people will impact their decision-making.

TOGO:
